## Execution

[@Sarlin-7757](https://github.com/Sarlin-7757) worked on the frontend and I worked on the backend.
For the frontend, the client wanted a minimal landing page for the homepage and a blog page for their articles. Since the client wanted a simple website and not a CMS, I decided to use Astro and MDX for the article pages. Instead of making a new CMS from scratch and writing the articles there, markdown files made it easier to upload new articles and can be done by a person wihout any knowledge of the development process. The markdown files are then converted to HTML using MDX and Astro. The website is hosted on Netlify.
